# Triditional approach

web + mobile -> rest api calls -> get response back

rest api intract with db and does operation

__cons__
1) multiple network calls
2) overfetching and under fetching of data
3) more bandwidth comsumption as unwanted data is sent to clinet too

# using GraphQL
1) enable user to fetch only required data with whatsoever shape they want with statically defining the type
2) faster than restAPI
3)
